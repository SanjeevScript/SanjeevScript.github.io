# Welcome to Sanjeev's Blog

Hi! I'm Sanjeev, a 12-year-old coder and gamer from Bengaluru. I love creating websites and games, including my current projects: a **Kirby game** in TypeScript and a **shooting game** in C#.

Here, I share my tips and tricks on coding, game development, and my other passion—badminton. Feel free to explore my posts and learn along with me!

## About Me

I’m passionate about both coding and gaming. You can check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/sanjeevscript). I’m also an avid player of **Valorant** and **Roblox**, and I enjoy making games as much as playing them.

## Projects in Progress

- **Kirby Game in TypeScript**: A fun, side-scrolling platformer inspired by the classic Kirby games.
- **Shooting Game in C#**: A dynamic, action-packed shooter with challenging levels and unique gameplay mechanics.

Stay tuned for updates on these projects, and I’ll be sharing my development journey and what I learn along the way!
