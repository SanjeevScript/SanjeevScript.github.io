# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my very first blog post! Iâ€™m thrilled to finally have my blog up and running. ðŸŽ‰

As a 12-year-old coder from Bengaluru, Iâ€™ve always been passionate about creating websites and games. After spending some time experimenting with different ideas, I decided to start this blog to share my journey and insights with you.

This blog will be a space where I share tips and tricks on coding, game development, and even some of my favorite activities like badminton. Iâ€™m particularly excited to write about the projects Iâ€™m working on, including a Kirby game in TypeScript and a shooting game in C#. 

Getting this blog live has been an exciting adventure in itself. From choosing the perfect Jekyll theme to setting up GitHub Pages, Iâ€™ve learned a lot along the way. I hope to make this blog a valuable resource for anyone interested in coding and game development, and I canâ€™t wait to dive into the content I plan to share.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. Stay tuned for more posts and updates!
